"Some people just can’t resist taking one more card. 
Write a procedure reckless that takes a strategy as its argument and returns another strategy. 
This new strategy should take one more card than the original would. 
(In other words, the new strategy should stand if the old strategy would stand on the butlast of the customer’s hand.)"
