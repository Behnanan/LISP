"Define a function majority that takes three strategies as arguments and produces a strategy as a result, 
such that the result strategy always decides whether or not to “hit” by consulting the three argument strategies, 
and going with the majority. That is, the result strategy should return #t 
if and only if at least two of the three argument strategies do. 
Using the three strategies from parts 2, 4, and 6 as argument strategies, 
play a few games using the “majority strategy” formed from these three."
