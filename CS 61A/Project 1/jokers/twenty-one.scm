"10. Copy your Scheme file to a new file, named joker.scm, before you begin
this problem. We are going to change the rules by adding two jokers to the deck. A joker
can be worth any number of points from 1 to 11. Modify whatever has to be modified to
make this work. (The main point of this exercise is precisely for you to figure out which
procedures must be modified.) You will submit both this new file and the original, non-
joker version for grading. You donâ€™t have to worry about making strategies optimal; just
be sure nothing blows up and the hands are totalled correctly."
