"On Valentineâ€™s Day, your local casino has a special deal: If you win a round of 21 with a heart in your hand, they pay double. 
You decide that if you have a heart in your hand, you should play more aggressively than usual. 
Write a valentine strategy that stops at 17 unless you have a heart in your hand, in which case it stops at 19."
