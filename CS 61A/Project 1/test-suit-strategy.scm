"Generalize part 6 above by defining a function suit-strategy that takes three arguments: a suit (h, s, d, or c), 
a strategy to be used if your hand doesnâ€™t include that suit, and a strategy to be used if your hand does include that suit. 
It should return a strategy that behaves accordingly. 
Show how you could use this function and the stop-at function from part 5 to redefine the valentine strategy of part 6."
